Turning Strings to URLs
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

// Questions to ask:
1. Can I use JS to solve this problem?
2. Can I assume that the input will always be a string?
3. Can I use JS built in methods to solve this problem?

//Solution:
 - split at each space and join replaces each space with %20 creating a new string

function replaceSpace(string) {
  let url = string.split(' ').join('%20'); 
  return url;
}
console.log(replaceSpace("Jasmine Ann Jones"));
